This file includes information about the implementation of the pairs_gui project
and gamerules for the game.

Instructions to play the game:
    When game starts, select wanted amount of cards to play with and wanted
amount of players. If you want, you can change players names. When ready, press
"Start" Settings view will og away and game starts.
    Click cards that are in the upper area of the window. Your mission is to
find 2 cards with a same character. When you do so, you'll get a point and can
continue. If there are more players that 2, if you open 2 cards, that are not a
pair, your turn ends and next player's turn begins.
    After all cards have been found, endScreen pops up and shows the winner
of the game, and time elapsed. If you want to continue playing, you can press
"Play Again" button to start a new game. Else you can quit the game by pressing
"Quit" button

About the implementation:
    Most of the game logic is in class MainWindow. Card is implemented as class
inherited from QPushButton to add extra features for a QPushButton. Settings
window is not an actual separate window, but it has been named assuch. I tried
different ways to have many widgets in the game (differenece between
settings window and endScreenWidget) Players are implemented as struct as they
don't need any special methods.


Included extra features:
    1. (10p)
    2. (5p)
    4. (5p)
    5. (10p)
    6. (10p)
    8. (10p)
